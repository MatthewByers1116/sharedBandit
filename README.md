Make a PDF README to tell people how to download the game and set up, assume they've never used a computer in their life
TODO: Fix grammer and instructions. When you run the py have it automatically pull up level 0 with the instructions on how to play

MAKE A WAY TO VALUDATE PASSWORDS.
  The passwords are to be made by a combination of username/password. So when the program launches for the first time (installation phase) we will request that they enter their PSU EMAIL and from that we will generate the password list by throwing it through some algorythems/hashes/soforth this way when they enter into the validation website we can have them enter in the password they got from the game and we can remotely determine if they did the work. 
          //Yes while this is insecure in the final product the students wont have acess to the code and if theyre smart enough to reverse engineer it they can get a free win, whatever.
